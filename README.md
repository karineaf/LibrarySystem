## üìñ Business Rules

* ‚úÖ A user can only reserve **one book at a time**
* ‚úÖ A comment **cannot be modified** after creation
* ‚úÖ To reserve a book:

  * The book must be **available**
  * The reservation can last a maximum of **30 days**
  * If the user reserves the same book again, they can keep it for another **30 days**
  * After that, they must wait at least **10 days** before reserving it again

* Add proper **logging** for debugging and monitoring
* Replace manual mapping with **MapStruct**
* Implement **Publisher** entity
* When deleting a book, also close **active reservations**
* Implement **reservation expiration** (notifications and future penalty rules)
* Validate **reviews** for offensive words
* Fix bug: deleting an **Author** also deletes co-authors of their books
